how to link CSS to HTML?
we can link css to html in three ways
---inline CSS:- we can apply styles in HTML elements opening tag, style as a attribute.
---internal css:-we can apply styles to any elements using style as a element
    syntax:-selector{
       // properties
    }
    Example:<!--Internal CSS-->
    <style>
        h1{
            background-color: brown;
            color: white;
        }
    </style>
----External CSS:- we can create seprate file and attach to HTML using link tag
    syntax:-<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">    

 inline >!important>Internal=External(mostly external dominates internal)  
 !important:-it will be added property value such that its prefrences will be higher level
 example:-<style>
        h2{
            background-color: blue !important;
        }
    </style> 
 Basic Selector :-selector are used to identify an element of HTML in CSS
 you can identify an elements basically in three ways:  
 --tag:we can define properties using tag so that all elements with that tag will be selected.
 --classname:-we need to select few elements we can assign same classname to all and identifythe classname in CSS using (.) notation
 example:<h2 class="Sub">Course Subject</h2>
 ------.Sub{color:"red";}
 --id:-if we need to select only one element we can use id .we can identify in css by using # notation.
 ------Example:<h2 id="Sub">Course Subject</h2>
            #sub{color:red;}
NOTE: an element might contain multiple classname and multiple elements might contain same classname.id's are always unique.
id>classname>tag



Combinators:-
1.Direct-child (>):-we can identify an elements direct child  using (>)
2.Desendeent:we can identify an elements using space combinators for desendents.
3.Adjacent Sibbling Selector(+):-we can identify an elements which comes right after another elements using (+)
4.General sibling selector(~):-we can identify an elements which comes  after an elements using (~).
